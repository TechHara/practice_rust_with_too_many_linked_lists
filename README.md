# Practice Rust with Too Many Linked Lists
This repo contains exercises directly from [Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/). Practice your Rust skills by writing the impelementation yourself. Test your code by running the tests in each module. 

I recommend to complete the modules in the order:
```
bad_stack
ok_stack
persistent_stack
bad_safe_deque
ok_unsafe_queue
prod_unsafe_deque
```
